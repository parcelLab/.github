[![YAML](https://github.com/parcelLab/.github/actions/workflows/yaml.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/parcelLab/.github/actions/workflows/yaml.yaml)

The `.github` repository works as a fallback for all the repositories in @parcelLab
that don't have an actual `.github` directory.

The intention of this repository is to be public, in order to share our Github configuration practices to the community.
