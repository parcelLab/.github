# Github Configuration

[![Verify workflows](https://github.com/parcelLab/.github/actions/workflows/ci.verify-workflows.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/parcelLab/.github/actions/workflows/ci.verify-workflows.yaml)

The `.github` repository works as a fallback for all the repositories in @parcelLab
that don't have an actual `.github` directory.

The intention of this repository is to be public, in order to share what we consider
good CI/CD and configuration practices to the community. While the structure is very
much solving parcelLab's unique use cases, the files here could be reused by anybody
else as they do not have any business logic attached.
