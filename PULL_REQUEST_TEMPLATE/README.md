# Pull Request Templates

You can select the pull request template using the `template` parameter as described
in [Using query parameters to create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/using-query-parameters-to-create-a-pull-request)

The pull request template by default is `pull_request_template.md` in the root folder.
